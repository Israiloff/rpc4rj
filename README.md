# Reactive JSON RPC 2.0 plugin for [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

[This](https://github.com/Israiloff/rpc4rj) project aims to simplify web exchange via 
[JSON RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) protocol in reactive manner. Names of the components and their 
usage are very similar to [JSON-RPC for Java (jsonrpc4j)](https://github.com/briandilley/jsonrpc4j) project 
(thanks a lot to your work folks, your project is awesome!). The main difference between 
the projects is that [this project](https://github.com/Israiloff/rpc4rj) is completely reactive, i.e. built on 
[project reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) aka [webflux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux.html) 
for the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
